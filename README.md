## Complex
This is an implementation of [complex data
type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_data_type) as a JavaScript class,
only written in TypeScript for static typing.  It is for educational purposes
on how to implement an [abstract data
type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) or what [complex
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) are, and is not
intended for practical use.

Complex numbers have two representations: rectangular and polar forms.  We
use the former internally to keep the real and imaginary parts in JavaScript
numbers (i.e., 64-bit floating-point numbers).

**Kind**: global variable  
**Properties**

| Name | Description |
